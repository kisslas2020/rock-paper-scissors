# rock-paper-scissors

~~For the moment the game can only be played from the browser console. To start a game, type the command: game(5), between parenthesis you should give the number of rounds (in this case: 5) you want to play.~~

The game got a simple UI to it:

- there are three buttons, one for each selection (rock, paper, scissors)
- the results are displayed on the screen, not by console.logs
- after the announcement of the winner, a new-game button will appear (it rhymes!)

The point has not changed: the winner is the one who gets five wins first.
